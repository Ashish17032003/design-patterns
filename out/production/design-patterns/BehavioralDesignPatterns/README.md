# What's a Behavioral Design Pattern    public Engine createEngine() {

1. Clearer Communication
   - Objects can communicate in a structured and organised way
   - specially important in large scale systems to avoid bugs

2. Decoupling
   - Objects don't need to know about each other
   
3. Flexibility
   - easily change or extend behaviour without modifying classes

4. Better organization
    - clean how objects should communicate like a to-do list
